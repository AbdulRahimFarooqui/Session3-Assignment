This is an exercise by Dave Ceddia in his blog post.
We needed to create a component named MediaCard which operates on 3 parameters; title, body and imageURL.
We did not create it in a sepearte file rather we rendered it on DOM, coding the component function in index.js directly by first removing everything the file contained.
In this Assignment I created a seperate file called MediaCard which is itself a component and imported it to App.js as sir Mohsin instructed.
## The Distinct Part
The values of the attributes of the component MediaCard are JSX tag tags and not simple values!
